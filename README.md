# Land-Registry-using-Blockchain-Technology

## Inspiration
"LandChain" refers to a blockchain-based system or platform specifically designed for land registry and property management purposes. It utilizes the power of blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent network that securely records and manages information related to land ownership, transfers, and other relevant data.

## What it does
In a LandChain system, each transaction or update related to land records is recorded on the blockchain, forming an immutable and tamper-proof history of ownership. This ensures increased transparency, reduces the potential for fraud, and enhances trust in the land registry process.
