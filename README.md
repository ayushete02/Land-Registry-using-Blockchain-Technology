## Introduction

In a LandChain system, each transaction or update related to land records is recorded on the blockchain, forming an immutable and tamper-proof history of ownership. This ensures increased transparency, reduces the potential for fraud, and enhances trust in the land registry process.

LandChain can provide benefits such as streamlined property transactions, efficient verification of land ownership, improved dispute resolution, and easier access to accurate and up-to-date land records. It aims to revolutionize the traditional
